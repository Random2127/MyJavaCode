# Java random projects 
---

Most of the current projects are the classical exercises that you get from class.

From beginner projects which I expect to master and do by heart to more complex projects I come across overtime.

#### Goal
The main aim is to remake the code three times trying to come up with any improvement I read about or think of. 
Making it error-proof, rewriting wich different loops, adding functions, ... all the stuff I'm suppossed to lear basically.

### Current

1. Calculator:
   - Basic
   - using functions
   - all operators, float, division error proof
2. Reversing a String:
   - for loop
   - while loop
   - with an array
3. Number guess game:
   - randomized number
   - user needs to figure out in 'X' attempts(hardcoded)
4. BattleShip game V1
   - first attempt with matrix
   - no function nor input control (to be reviewed)
   - expecting to randomize position of ships
