# Java random projects 
---

Most of the current projects are the classical exercises that you get from class.

From beginner projects which I expect to master and do by heart to more complex projects I come across overtime.

#### Goal
The main aim is to remake the code three times trying to come up with any improvement I read about or think of. 
Making it error-proof, rewriting wich different loops, adding functions, ... all the stuff I'm suppossed to lear basically.

### Current

1. Calculator:
   - Basic
   - using function
   - division error proof
3. Reversing a String:
   - for loop
